# dodgeball

To build and run the program execute in your shell:

```shell
stack build && stack exec dodgeball-exe
```

This is the hangman game where a random word will be selected to be guess.

You will have 5 attemps and in each attempt you will receive the feedback of eeach letter match.

Good luck!
